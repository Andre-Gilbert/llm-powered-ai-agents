    "## 1. Understanding LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding LLMs requires balancing algorithmic reasoning and human thought. Algorithmic reasoning is deterministic, producing consistent outcomes from identical inputs, unlike human thought, which is creative and subjective. LLMs lie between these extremes: they are fluent in natural language but do not truly understand what they say. They can execute algorithms but are limited in proficiency. Practically, executing algorithms involves using tools for desired outcomes. LLMs thus represent a hybrid, processing and generating text while relying on external software for algorithm execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are like new employees who need guidance and tools to perform well. They have potential and language skills but depend on external resources to execute tasks effectively. Providing necessary resources ensures their optimal performance, just as with new hires. Neglecting essential guidance or tools may require adjustments, akin to adapting to the needs of a new employee to ensure success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider both system prompts and task prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System prompts:** Set general behavior guidelines, such as the persona the LLM should adopt or how it should handle specific tasks and edge cases. For instance, instruct the LLM to check the date before other tasks or respond in a specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task prompts:** For simple queries, a direct question might suffice. For complex tasks, use structured prompts. For example, when classifying an IT ticket, provide clear details about the ticket, user, and date to ensure accurate handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best results from LLMs, it's important to craft clear and effective prompts. Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Start with something simple and add more details later. Things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be specific:** Provide detailed information to help the LLM understand your query and give tailored responses.\n",
    "2. **Ask clear questions:** Ask one question at a time to minimize confusion.\n",
    "3. **Ask follow-up questions:** Clarify incomplete or unclear initial responses with rephrased queries or additional context.\n",
    "4. **Use full sentences:** Provide context with clear and concise sentences.\n",
    "5. **Provide examples:** Use examples to help the LLM understand your requirements and respond appropriately."

    "The following question demonstrates how the LLM processes a user's query about the number of earthquakes that occurred on the current day. Using the provided tools, the LLM first retrieves the current date and time. This initial step is crucial for identifying and counting the seismic activities for the day. This process shows the power of [Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), particularly the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) prompting method, which enables the AI to tackle multi-step problems. By breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps — first obtaining the current date, then querying the relevant seismic data — the LLM can deliver correct answers."

    "An excellent application of LLMs involves organizing unstructured data, such as text documents. Take, for instance, a collection of job descriptions. While there are various methods to tackle this task, like coding a parser or using optical character recognition, we opt to leverage an LLM for the job. Initially, we define the specific information we wish to extract from the job postings, such as the job title, salary, application instructions, and more. The LLM then looks at each job description and extracts the details for us. Subsequently, we can effortlessly store this dataset as a CSV file for further analysis and use."

    "\n",
    "When tasks assigned to an LLM become too complex, it is essential to divide the AI agent into multiple components. The common approach is to split the AI agent into multiple agents with specific goals, either sequentially chaining them or linking them in a graph-like structure. This is one way to let multiple LLMs collaborate to solve a specific problem."

    "### Comparing Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two job descriptions, one approach involves presenting both job postings to an LLM to identify similarities and differences. However, this method may not yield optimal results, as job descriptions often include non-essential information such as \"equal employment opportunity\" statements. To address this, we can deconstruct the problem by initially tasking an LLM to extract relevant data from each job description. In our case 2 instances as we are comparing 2 jobs. Subsequently, this condensed information can be inputted into a 3rd LLM, tasked with analyzing the extracted data to identify differences and similarities between the two jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured format of the input and output fields in the graph enables us to reference data across the entire chain. This flexibility allows us to control exactly what each LLM processes. By tailoring the information each LLM receives, we ensure they have the essential data to solve their specific task, while also preventing unnecessary information. This approach not only reduces costs but also safeguards against misleading inputs that could compromise the quality of the LLM outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a concern may arise if an LLM fails to provide the expected output, potentially breaking the entire workflow from a software perspective. As mentioned previously, in the event of a missing output, we use a default response. In this example walkthrough, we output \"None\" for all fields. Consequently, we pass \"None\" to all subsequent LLMs, ensuring they can still execute without encountering errors. However, it's important to note that the final output of the chain could also be \"None\" since the subsequent LLMs won't be able to solve the problem without the necessary input or the LLM could prompt the user to provide more information, telling the user to try again. \n",
    "Additionally, you can equip LLMs with tools to enhance their functionality, allowing each model to solve multi-step subproblems before passing the results to the next model in the chain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider using an AI agent to generate machine learning code. Initially, you might think to give the LLM a piece of the dataset to generate the code. But this simple idea might not work well. The LLM could make mistakes, like treating a classification task as a regression because of how the classes are represented numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, you could have the LLM figure out the problem type first, using insights from the dataset and prompts from the user, before generating any code. While this sounds doable with just one agent, it actually makes things more complicated when it comes to formatting the output. Sometimes, the LLM will output the code along with a description of the problem type and other information, while other times, it will solely respond with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simpler, it's better to split the AI agent into two parts that work together. The 1st LLM looks at the dataset and problem description to figure out what kind of machine learning problem it is, like classification. Then, the 2nd LLM uses this info to generate machine learning code. This split not only makes things easier for the LLMs but also helps humans understand the structure more easily. It also simplifies the process of adjusting the prompts to ensure that the LLM only responds with code.\n",

Another approach involves embedding an AI agent within a function that receives arguments, turning it into a tool like any other function in code. The true strength of LLMs lies in their ability to use tools. By leveraging this capability, we can construct a network of interconnected functionalities, where LLMs utilize tools that are powered by LLMs.\n",

This enables the LLM to answer multi-domain questions effectively."
