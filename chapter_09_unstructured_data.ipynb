    "# Chapter 09: Working with Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, companies are inundated with vast amounts of unstructured data, including documents, slides, emails, and more. Transforming this unstructured data into structured formats is crucial for unlocking its full potential. Leveraging LLMs enables businesses to efficiently convert unstructured information into datasets that can be stored in databases, CSV files, and other structured formats. This transformation not only facilitates data management but also allows for the training of machine learning models on the structured datasets. Ultimately, structured data can be seamlessly integrated into various workflows, functions, and processes, enabling more informed decision-making across the organization."

    "For sentiment analysis of tweets, we can automate the process using an LLM to classify sentiment and store its reasoning. Instead of a chat-based application where users manually input tweets, the LLM can analyze tweets in bulk, classify sentiment, and record reasoning. Additionally, the LLM can extract properties such as tagged users and hashtags."

    "## Drafting Contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to using LLMs to draft contracts, it's important to consider that contracts are often lengthy documents, sometimes spanning over 100 pages. This renders conversation-based applications impractical, as LLMs cannot generate such extensive documents, and users prefer not to interact directly with the LLM and manage its outputs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a potential approach for an application to draft contracts: Rather than expecting the LLM to generate the entire document at once, we can break it down into manageable sections. Users could provide bullet points for each section, allowing the LLM to formulate the corresponding paragraphs and suggest a title for each section. The application would then concatenate these outputs to create a document. Additionally, in practical scenarios, it's likely necessary to grant the LLM access to specific laws or legal references in some manner."

    "## Generating Machine Learning Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using an AI agent to generate machine learning code. Initially, you might think to give the LLM a piece of the dataset to generate the code. But this simple idea might not work well. The LLM could make mistakes, like treating a classification task as a regression because of how the classes are represented numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, you could have the LLM figure out the problem type first, using insights from the dataset and prompts from the user, before generating any code. While this sounds doable with just one agent, it actually makes things more complicated when it comes to formatting the output. Sometimes, the LLM will output the code along with a description of the problem type and other information, while other times, it will solely respond with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simpler, it's better to split the AI agent into two parts that work together. The 1st LLM looks at the dataset and problem description to figure out what kind of machine learning problem it is, like classification. Then, the 2nd LLM uses this info to generate machine learning code. This split not only makes things easier for the LLMs but also helps humans understand the structure more easily. It also simplifies the process of adjusting the prompts to ensure that the LLM only responds with code.\n",

    "An excellent application of LLMs involves organizing unstructured data, such as text documents. Take, for instance, a collection of job descriptions. While there are various methods to tackle this task, like coding a parser or using optical character recognition, we opt to leverage an LLM for the job. Initially, we define the specific information we wish to extract from the job postings, such as the job title, salary, application instructions, and more. The LLM then looks at each job description and extracts the details for us. Subsequently, we can effortlessly store this dataset as a CSV file for further analysis and use."
