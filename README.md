# LLM-powered AI Agents

In today's fast-paced world of AI, there is an increasing demand for custom AI solutions. This repository is dedicated to helping individuals develop an intuition about Large Language Models (LLMs). From integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporating specific tools and choosing functionalities, your decisions should closely align with the unique needs of your use case. To achieve this, businesses must cultivate a profound understanding of LLMs. This repository is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the capabilities, limitations, and workings of LLMs. By the end, you should have a relatively deep knowledge of AI, LLMs, and RAG more generally.

**Disclaimer:** This repository reflects my personal approach to understanding and leveraging LLMs. It is by no means the only way to utilize LLMs effectively. My aim is to share insights and methods that have worked for me, but there are many other valid and effective strategies. I encourage you to explore various perspectives and find what best suits your needs and use cases.
