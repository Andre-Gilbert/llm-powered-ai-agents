The INTERVIEW is a behavior-based review of a candidate's personal history. It is designed to evaluate initiative in learning, practical orientation, role adaptability, service orientation, oral communication skills, job motivation, teamwork, and respect for diversity. The minimum passing score is 70. This score will determine a candidate's rank on the eligible list, which is valid for one year from the date of the interview. This is an extremely competitive examination and a sufficient number of candidates with the highest scores will continue in the selection process.\n2. Based on a candidate's ranking on the eligible list and the hiring needs of the Fire Department, candidates with the highest scores will be selected for a BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. The background investigation will consist of a background appointment and field investigation. The background investigation is conducted to evaluate: interpersonal skills, sensitivity, and respect for others; decision-making and judgment; maturity and discipline; honesty, integrity, and personal ethics; setting and achieving goals; and a records check.\n3. A MEDICAL EXAMINATION is conducted by a City physician to evaluate the candidate's medical fitness (vision, hearing, cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.) to perform the full range of Firefighter duties, with no conditions which would affect the candidate's ability to safely perform those duties.\n4. A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION (including written tests, and possibly an interview by a City Psychologist) is conducted to evaluate the candidate's psychological fitness to safely perform the full range of Firefighter duties.\n\nADDITIONAL JOB INFORMATION\n\nCandidate Advancement Program (CAP): Candidates selected in the stratified random sampling and who move forward in the selection process after the interview will be required to complete the CAP Fitness Assessment. The CAP Fitness Assessment results are advisory. Candidates will also be required to maintain the CAP Fitness Assessment Logbook throughout the field investigation.  The CAP Fitness Assessment Logbook must be completed by the conclusion of the field investigation. \n \nAfter the field investigation is conducted, a REVIEW OF QUALIFICATIONS will be completed by representatives from the Fire Department, which may include a department interview. This review may include the evaluation of the candidate's training, experience, personal qualifications, and findings of the background investigation as they prepared the candidate for the job of Firefighter. Based on hiring needs, those candidates with the strongest qualifications will receive a conditional job offer from the Fire Department and be scheduled for the medical and psychological evaluation. This is an extremely competitive examination and there are relatively few positions to be filled. Based on this, not all candidates reviewed will be selected for further processing.\n\nPHYSICAL: Firefighting and medical rescue work is physically demanding.  Candidates must be in excellent health and have no conditions which would restrict their ability to safely perform fire suppression and rescue work.  Weight (body fat content) must be proportionate to height. \n\nVISION: Uncorrected distance visual acuity of at least 20/100 in the poorer eye and 20/40 in the better eye, correctable to at least 20/40 in one eye and 20/20 in the other eye is required.  Regarding refractive surgery, most persons who have had these procedures will be passed.  However, some may be deferred for several months or disqualified based on an individualized assessment of the surgical outcome.  Regarding color vision, candidates must be able to accurately and quickly name colors and be free of other visual impairments that would restrict their ability to perform Firefighter duties.\n\nTOBACCO: Firefighters are required to refrain from all use of tobacco throughout their employment with the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nDRUG & ALCOHOL SCREENING: A drug and alcohol screening test may be required at any time prior to appointment because Firefighter has been designated as a safety sensitive class.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1.
