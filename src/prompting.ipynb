    "To get the best results from LLMs, it's important to craft clear and effective prompts. Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Start with something simple and add more details later. Things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be specific:** Provide detailed information to help the LLM understand your query and give tailored responses.\n",
    "2. **Ask clear questions:** Ask one question at a time to minimize confusion.\n",
    "3. **Ask follow-up questions:** Clarify incomplete or unclear initial responses with rephrased queries or additional context.\n",
    "4. **Use full sentences:** Provide context with clear and concise sentences.\n",
    "5. **Provide examples:** Use examples to help the LLM understand your requirements and respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider both system prompts and task prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System prompts:** Set general behavior guidelines, such as the persona the LLM should adopt or how it should handle specific tasks and edge cases. For instance, instruct the LLM to check the date before other tasks or respond in a specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task prompts:** For simple queries, a direct question might suffice. For complex tasks, use structured prompts. For example, when classifying an IT ticket, provide clear details about the ticket, user, and date to ensure accurate handling."

      "\n",
      "Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum bits, or qubits, to process information. This is different from classical computing, which uses binary digits, or bits.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Qubits**: In classical computing, a bit is either a 0 or a 1. A quantum bit, or qubit, however, can be both a 0 and a 1 at the same time, thanks to a property called superposition. This means that a quantum computer can process a vast number of possibilities all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Superposition**: As mentioned above, superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states at once. This means that if you have two qubits, you don't just have two states (like you would with classical bits), but four: 00, 01, 10, and 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Entanglement**: This is another quantum property. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit becomes linked with the state of another. No matter how far apart they are, a change in one will affect the other. This is a key resource for quantum computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Quantum Gates**: Just like classical computers use logic gates to perform operations on bits, quantum computers use quantum gates to perform operations on qubits. However, quantum gates are more powerful because they can process all possible inputs at once due to superposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Quantum Speedup**: Because of these properties, quantum computers can solve certain types of problems much faster than classical computers. This is often referred to as quantum speedup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computing is a complex and rapidly evolving field. It has the potential to revolutionize many areas, including cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery. However, it's also worth noting that practical, large-scale quantum computing is still a work in progress.\n"
