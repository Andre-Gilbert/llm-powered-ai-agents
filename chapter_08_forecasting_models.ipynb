    "# Chapter 08: LLMs integrating with Forecasting Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating LLMs with forecasting tools is a powerful strategy for enhancing decision-making across various domains. LLMs excel at interpreting complex datasets and generating actionable insights. When combined with forecasting models, this synergy allows for automatic forecast interpretation and action recommendations. While applications such as demand forecasting and machine degradation predictions are common, our focus will be on earthquake forecasting. We will outline practical steps for integrating LLMs with forecasting models, demonstrating how this combination can transform abstract concepts into actionable and insightful implementations."

    "## Use Case: Automating Earthquake Forecast Inquiries\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating LLMs with forecasting tools offers a transformative approach to managing inquiries about earthquake forecasts. Currently, handling these inquiries involves significant manual effort, with responses being drafted and sent individually. By automating this process, we can streamline operations and enhance efficiency. To automate responses to earthquake forecast inquiries effectively, we will design a workflow that integrates various steps, starting from the receipt of an email and ending in the generation of an email response, ensuring accurate and timely replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Extracting relevant information**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the unstructured data in the email body, we first leverage an LLM. The LLM is tasked with extracting key details such as the regions and the forecasting horizon. To ensure that the regions are in the same format as the dataset, the LLM is tasked to provide the extracted region names in a format that matches the datasetâ€™s spelling. This step is crucial as it transforms the free-form text into structured data."

      "Dear User,\n",
      "\n",
      "We are writing to inform you about the earthquake forecasts for the next 5 days in the regions of California, Japan, and Greece.\n",
      "\n",
      "In California, the forecasted magnitudes range from 1.29 to 1.32, with depths ranging from 7.05 to 7.33 km. These are relatively low magnitudes and depths, suggesting minor seismic activity. Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant danger for this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Japan, the forecasted magnitudes range from 4.52 to 4.75, with depths ranging from 62.89 to 85.62 km. These are moderate magnitudes and depths, indicating a possibility of noticeable seismic activity. Residents should be alert and prepared for potential earthquakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Greece, the forecasted magnitudes range from 4.43 to 4.85, with depths ranging from 25.02 to 32.56 km. These are also moderate magnitudes and depths, suggesting a potential for noticeable seismic activity. Residents should be prepared and stay alert.\n",
      "\n",
      "For regions with noticeable seismic activity, we recommend the following actions:\n",
      "1. Prepare an emergency kit with essential items.\n",
      "2. Secure heavy items that could fall and cause injuries.\n",
      "3. Identify safe spots in your home where you can take cover.\n",
      "4. Make a family emergency communication plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these forecasts are based on current data and are subject to change. Stay updated with the latest forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best regards,\n",
