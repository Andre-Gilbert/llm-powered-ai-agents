    "Understanding LLMs requires balancing algorithmic reasoning and human thought. Algorithmic reasoning is deterministic, producing consistent outcomes from identical inputs, unlike human thought, which is creative and subjective. LLMs lie between these extremes: they are fluent in natural language but do not truly understand what they say. They can execute algorithms but are limited in proficiency. Practically, executing algorithms involves using tools for desired outcomes. LLMs thus represent a hybrid, processing and generating text while relying on external software for algorithm execution.\n",

    "LLMs are like new employees who need guidance and tools to perform well. They have potential and language skills but depend on external resources to execute tasks effectively. Providing necessary resources ensures their optimal performance, just as with new hires. Neglecting essential guidance or tools may require adjustments, akin to adapting to the needs of a new employee to ensure success."
