    "# Chapter 08: LLMs integrating with Forecasting Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating LLMs with forecasting tools is a powerful strategy for enhancing decision-making across various domains. LLMs excel at interpreting complex datasets and generating actionable insights. When combined with forecasting models, this synergy allows for automatic forecast interpretation and action recommendations. While applications such as demand forecasting and machine degradation predictions are common, our focus will be on earthquake forecasting. We will outline practical steps for integrating LLMs with forecasting models, demonstrating how this combination can transform abstract concepts into actionable and insightful implementations."

    "## Use Case: Automating Earthquake Forecast Inquiries\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating LLMs with forecasting tools offers a transformative approach to managing inquiries about earthquake forecasts. Currently, handling these inquiries involves significant manual effort, with responses being drafted and sent individually. By automating this process, we can streamline operations and enhance efficiency. To automate responses to earthquake forecast inquiries effectively, we will design a workflow that integrates various steps, starting from the receipt of an email and ending in the generation of an email response, ensuring accurate and timely replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Extracting relevant information**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the unstructured data in the email body, we first leverage an LLM. The LLM is tasked with extracting key details such as the regions and the forecasting horizon. To ensure that the regions are in the same format as the dataset, the LLM is tasked to provide the extracted region names in a format that matches the datasetâ€™s spelling. This step is crucial as it transforms the free-form text into structured data."

      "In California, the forecasted magnitudes range from 1.037 to 1.193, with depths ranging from 7.25 to 7.57. These are relatively low magnitudes and depths, so the region is not in immediate danger. However, we recommend monitoring seismic activity and ensuring that earthquake safety measures are in place.\n",

      "In Japan, the forecasted magnitudes range from 4.487 to 4.828, with depths ranging from 67.94 to 87.03. These are moderate magnitudes and depths, which could potentially cause damage. We recommend that the region prepares for potential earthquakes, including reviewing and implementing earthquake safety measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Greece, the forecasted magnitudes range from 4.305 to 4.697, with depths ranging from 16.54 to 28.62. These are moderate magnitudes and depths, which could potentially cause damage. We recommend that the region prepares for potential earthquakes, including reviewing and implementing earthquake safety measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these are forecasts and actual seismic activity may vary. We recommend staying alert and following the advice of local authorities and experts in the event of an earthquake.\n",
