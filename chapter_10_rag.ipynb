    "# Chapter 10: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important improvement for LLMs. It combines the power of LLMs with the ability to fetch real-time information. Instead of just relying on the data they were trained on, these AI agents can now pull in relevant external data as they generate responses. This means they can give more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware answers. This makes them more effective in areas like conversational AI, decision support, and automated research. You may have noticed that when an LLM uses tools, it forms its final answer based on the output of the last tool it called, often pulling data from a JSON response. In RAG, the focus shifts to giving the LLM the ability to answer questions using information from documents."

    "Integrating RAG into AI systems can significantly enhance LLM responses. RAG allows the LLM to reference a knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. This is useful when dealing with documents or content specific to your business that LLMs may not be familiar with. By using external information to ground the LLM, it can effectively answer questions related to those topics. However, careful implementation is essential.\n",

    "Every naive implementation of RAG, including those demonstrated previously and others (RAG + keyword search, RAG + re-ranking, etc.), encounters a common challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive RAG is adequate for handling single-object scenarios. For example, if the vector space consists solely of documents related to earthquakes, cars, or jobs, a naive RAG approach can be sufficient. However, this simplistic method struggles to ensure that the retrieved documents provide the necessary context to effectively address a query. When projecting an embedding into the vector space and retrieving the five closest neighbors or most similar documents, there's no guarantee that these documents will pertain exclusively to the specific object of interest, leading to potential inaccuracies in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "![naive-rag-vector-space](./assets/images/naive-rag-vector-space.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our basic demonstration, we've confined our vector space to contain only documents about job postings and applicant resumes. However, the LLM's responses remain subpar. After reviewing the logs of the LLM's Chain-of-Thought process, we can see that all the information retrieved is from applicant resumes where individuals have previously worked as accountants. While this information might be relevant in some contexts, it’s not always useful for answering the query accurately. We can improve the process by filtering out such irrelevant documents from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using contextual compression, where another LLM reviews and filters documents to remove irrelevant content, we observed that it successfully eliminated irrelevant documents in this instance. However, this outcome is not guaranteed in every case, so we should not overly depend on the LLM's judgment alone. Additionally, this method has a drawback: by filtering out documents deemed irrelevant, the LLM reduces the context available. This reduced information might limit the LLM's ability to provide a high-quality response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Envision a scenario where our document repository extends beyond job postings and applicant resumes to include a range of materials integral to our hiring process. Applicants provide documents such as cover letters; recruiters, engineers, and managers maintain notes from interviews; and departments hold documents outlining team compositions and project details for prospective hires. If all these documents were incorporated into the vector space, it could worsen the issue, leading to further deterioration in the LLM's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge arises from the ambiguity in document usage and accessibility. For instance, when querying about an accountant position, applicant resumes may mention prior experience in the role, recruiters/engineers may record interactions related to airport engineering roles, and departments may outline their need for such positions. This lack of control over document utilization and access complicates the task and contributes to the degradation of the LLM's responses. For improved outcomes, we can use an ontology/knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, we could add metadata, such as job titles, to achieve similar results to the ontology/knowledge graph implementation. However, as mentioned earlier, we assume there are documents related to other entities as well. This complicates the situation because documents tied to different business objects may contain different metadata. While searching using metadata is still possible, it would require filtering through numerous documents, which is slow. In addition, managing documents with different metadata in the same database is tedious, and sometimes databases don't support this level of complexity. This approach would also make it more difficult for users to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might consider standardizing all documents to include all metadata, but this would lead to many documents being filled with irrelevant metadata and dummy values, resulting in significant inefficiency in space usage. Another issue is the potential for metadata fields to have the same name across different business objects, which would prevent exclusive searches for relevant documents. Additionally, some metadata, like document creation dates or filenames, might not be known to users, who could simply look up the documents if they had this information. Therefore, in our showcase, we perform a simple search without metadata filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ontology/Knowledge Graph Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing knowledge ontology/knowledge graph-based RAG presents a pragmatic solution. When considering knowledge graphs, we often envision structures similar to the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![knowledge-graph](./assets/images/knowledge-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we need to recalibrate our perception of knowledge graphs within the framework of LLMs. Ideally, we aim to create a digital twin of our business processes, wherein nodes symbolize objects and edges denote their links. Since the use case was introduced earlier, we're already familiar with the entities engaged in the hiring process. This includes applicants, who provide documents such as cover letters and resumes, along with additional metadata like their name, birthday, degrees, and responses to application questions. Additionally, individuals involved in the process - such as recruiters, engineers, and hiring managers - may maintain notes about applicants from interviews, alongside metadata such as name, birthday, and department affiliation. Furthermore, departments play a role, providing both metadata and documents, and the job postings themselves contain metadata such as job title, salary range, department, and required technical skills. The figure below provides a basic outline of the process. While it may not depict every detail accurately, it conveys the overall concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "![knowledge-graph-vector-space](./assets/images/knowledge-graph-vector-space.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've established the ontology/knowledge graph, we can initially locate the relevant object or entity related to the question. Moreover, we can leverage the available metadata to refine our search process, effectively reducing the pool of documents to be searched. Essentially, this allows us to exclude entirely irrelevant documents and focus solely on those that are highly relevant. This structure also provides enhanced control and security. We can decide how the ontology/knowledge graph is traversed and specify which data, including metadata, the LLM is permitted to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to use an ontology/knowledge graph with subgraphs for more granular data representation."

    "As evident from the improved response of the LLM, the ontology/knowledge graph approach ensures that the model exclusively accesses documents about an accountant, thereby enhancing its performance. Scaling the solution to encompass multiple entities and numerous documents allows us to effectively filter out irrelevant content, concentrating solely on significant documents. Consequently, this boosts the likelihood of the LLM receiving high-quality documents to address the task. \n",

    "In conclusion, we ought to separate our business components before enhancing our information retrieval and generation process to ensure the best results. If RAG doesn't improve the LLM's answer quality, you might consider taking an additional step: fine-tuning a model specifically for the domain and optionally integrating RAG for further enhancement."
