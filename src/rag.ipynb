    "Every naive implementation of RAG, including those demonstrated previously and others, encounters a common challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive RAG is adequate for handling highly specific objects. For instance, if the vector space contains only documents related to earthquakes or a particular car model, naive RAG might suffice. However, such simplistic RAG solutions present difficulties in ensuring that the retrieved documents contain the necessary context to address the query effectively. For example, when projecting an embedding into the vector space and examining the closest 5 neighbors or the 5 most similar documents, there's no guarantee that we'll only obtain documents related to the specific object of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "![naive-rag-vector-space](../img/naive-rag-vector-space.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our basic demonstration, we've confined our vector space to contain solely documents about the job listings; nonetheless, the LLM's responses remain subpar. After reviewing the logs of the LLM's Chain-of-Thought process, it is evident that the search tool retrieves irrelevant documents, such as those discussing unrelated roles like an airport police captain. While the information about the airport police captain could potentially be used to formulate an answer, it ultimately depends on the LLM. However, we can enhance the process by excluding such irrelevant documents from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, envision a scenario where our document repository extends beyond job-related materials to encompass various entities integral to our recruitment process. Applicants provide documents such as resumes and cover letters; recruiters, engineers, and managers maintain candidate-related notes from interviews; departments house documents outlining team compositions and project details for prospective hires. If all these documents were incorporated into the vector space, it would worsen the issue, leading to further deterioration in the LLM's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge arises from the ambiguity in document usage and accessibility. For instance, when querying about an airport engineer position, applicant documents may mention prior experience in the role, recruiters/engineers may record interactions related to airport engineering roles, and departments may outline their need for such positions. This lack of control over document utilization and access complicates the task and contributes to the degradation of the LLM's responses. For improved outcomes, we can use knowledge graphs."

    "\n",
    "![knowledge-graph](../img/knowledge-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we need to recalibrate our perception of knowledge graphs within the framework of LLMs. Ideally, we aim to create a digital twin of our business processes, wherein nodes symbolize objects and edges denote their links. Since the use case was introduced earlier, we're already familiar with the entities engaged in the hiring process. This includes applicants, who provide documents such as cover letters and resumes, along with additional metadata like their name, birthday, degrees, and responses to application questions. Additionally, individuals involved in the process — such as recruiters, engineers, and hiring managers — may maintain notes about applicants from interviews, alongside metadata such as name, birthday, and department affiliation. Furthermore, departments play a role, providing both metadata and documents, and the job postings themselves contain metadata such as job title, salary range, department, and required technical skills. The figure below provides a basic outline of the process. While it may not depict every detail accurately, it conveys the overall concept effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "![knowledge-graph-vector-space](../img/knowledge-graph-vector-space.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've established the graph, we can utilize traversal methods like depth-first search and breadth-first search. This enables us to initially locate the relevant object or entity related to the question. Moreover, we can leverage the available metadata to refine our search process, effectively reducing the pool of documents to be searched. Essentially, this allows us to exclude entirely irrelevant documents and focus solely on those that are highly relevant. This structure also provides enhanced control and security. We can decide how the graph is traversed and specify which data, including metadata, the LLM is permitted to access."

    "As evident from the improved response of the LLM, our approach ensures that the model exclusively accesses documents about an airport engineer, thereby enhancing its performance. Scaling the solution to encompass multiple entities and numerous documents allows us to effectively filter out irrelevant content, concentrating solely on significant documents. Consequently, this significantly boosts the likelihood of the LLM receiving high-quality documents to address the task. If RAG doesn't improve the LLM's answer quality, you might consider taking an additional step: fine-tuning a model specifically for the domain and optionally integrating RAG for further enhancement.\n",
