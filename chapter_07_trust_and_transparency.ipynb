    "# Chapter 07: Building Trust and Transparency in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era where LLMs are becoming increasingly embedded in various facets of our daily lives, the need for trust and transparency has never been more critical. As these sophisticated systems take on roles ranging from customer service representatives to content creators, their influence grows, raising important questions about their reliability, decision-making processes, and ethical implications. We will begin by exploring how users can build trust in LLMs through transparency, allowing users to have confidence in the outputs and behaviors of LLMs."

    "## Governed Tool Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Governed tool access entails implementing tiered access levels for tools, delineating permissions based on the tool’s nature and the associated risks. Tools may be classified into categories such as executable, requiring approval before execution, or merely suggestible. Achieving governed tool access involves embedding checks within the AI agent’s code to regulate tool usage. When an LLM opts to employ a particular tool, the software code verifies the tool’s permissions and determines the appropriate course of action based on the access level. For our purposes, we simply add a property to the tool object that specifies whether the tool requires approval or not."

This includes thoughts, tools used, and observations made during the interaction. By visualizing the thought-tool-observation loop, users can gain a better understanding of how the AI agent arrived at its final response. This transparency not only builds trust but also enables users to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the AI agent’s decision-making process. For instance, when viewing the Chain-of-Thought, users can examine whether the AI agent correctly provides tool inputs. If a user requests sales data for the past week, the input date range should ideally span from the start date of today minus 7 days to the end date of today, ensuring accurate data retrieval. Observing such details within the reasoning process empowers users to evaluate the AI agent’s adherence to input requirements and adjust the system prompt and task prompt accordingly. The same applies to workflows. On the other hand, when using Single Completion, agents generate a direct output in response to a user query, bypassing the reasoning process."

    "## Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring plays a pivotal role in ensuring the effective operation and reliability of LLMs. Given the intricate and evolving nature of these systems, continuous oversight is essential to detect anomalies, resolve performance issues, and maintain user trust. One fundamental aspect of monitoring involves logging every interaction between users and the AI agent. This comprehensive logging provides transparency, allowing users to review past decisions and understand the context in which they were made and by whom. It also facilitates accountability, allowing developers to identify and address misuse or violations of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, monitoring encompasses the evaluation of tool utilization within the AI agent. By tracking which tools are frequently or infrequently used, developers can make informed decisions about system optimization. Tools that are rarely utilized may be removed to streamline the system and reduce costs, while those frequently used can be prioritized for enhancements to improve their effectiveness. Visualizing tool usage through graphical representations provides further insights into the AI agent's behavior, helping to identify whether the system is functioning as expected or if performance issues need to be addressed. This approach allows developers to fine-tune the AI’s operations based on actual usage patterns and user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, monitoring also involves assessing the economic aspects of operating LLMs. By tracking the consumption of tokens and other resources, users can evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their AI agents. This financial oversight helps in making strategic decisions about transitioning to more cost-efficient models while balancing performance needs. Overall, a comprehensive monitoring strategy, including tool usage analysis, financial tracking, and transparent logging, is essential for maintaining trust and transparency in LLMs. These practices not only uphold ethical standards but also enable developers to continuously improve and adapt their AI solutions to meet user expectations and operational requirements."
